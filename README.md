# Where-s-Fluffy-C4-System-Architecture
Where's Fluffy â€“ An Architecture Kata Case Study


 

## Overview

**Where's Fluffy?** is a design case study developed during an Architecture Kata session. The project focuses on building a user-centric, secure, and scalable solution for finding lost pets. The platform aims to integrate real-time tracking, photo-verified sightings, and a rewards mechanism across web and mobile applications.

This repository includes:
- C4 model diagrams (System Context, Container, Component levels)
- Team collaboration insights
- Tools & practices used
- Project reflections, learnings, and next steps

---

### Aim:
Design a scalable, user-centric platform that enables real-time discovery and retrieval of lost pets.

### Objectives:
- Create a multi-platform solution (web + mobile)
- Use GPS for pet sightings
- Implement secure reward and verification systems
- Design using the **C4 Model** for clarity and scale

---

## Process



### 1. Problem Analysis
We identified three key stakeholders:
- Pet owners searching for their pets
- Finders posting verified sightings
- Local business partners supporting the platform

Primary use cases:
- Reporting a missing pet
- Posting pet sightings (with photo verification)
- Disbursing and claiming rewards
- Tracking pet sighting locations
- Viewing/searching based on proximity

### 2. C4 Architecture Design
We used the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/) to structure our solution:

- **System Context**
  - User interacts via mobile/web platforms
  - Admins manage listings and validations
  - Third-party services (e.g., GPS, payment providers) integrate for core functionalities

- **Containers**
  - Frontend: Mobile app + web interface
  - Backend: REST APIs + authentication layer + payment processor
  - Data layer: NoSQL DB for listings, SQL DB for transactions

- **Components**
  - Auth Module (Login/Register, OAuth integration)
  - Lost Pet Reporting
  - Sighting Verifications (photo + geolocation)
  - Reward Management
  - Notifications (email, push)

- **Code-Level Consideration**
  - Component-based structure (e.g., Next.js for frontend, FastAPI backend)
  - CI/CD planning and modularity for scalability

Tooling and Best Practices
- **Miro**: Used for collaboration and brainstorming
- **Design Practices**: Focused on security, scalability, clarity, and adaptability
- **Architectural Thinking**: Balance flexibility with intentional design decisions

## Reflections & Learnings

This session was full of moments of clarity and curiosity.

Key Takeaways
- **Think Beyond the Tools**: Tools are helpers, but the real value is in clarity and alignment.
- **Start Imperfectly**: A design draft is just the beginning. Iterate.
- **Balance Detail and Simplicity**: Don't over-engineer. Make your design understandable.
- **Collaborate Deeply**: Include everyone's voice in design discussions.
- **Design for Adaptability**: Prioritize decisions that can evolve as the system grows.


---

## Next Steps
- Prototype MVP with pet reporting, sightings, and notifications
- Refine C4 diagrams based on feedback
- Explore microservices or serverless patterns for scalability
- Test architecture decisions by building a small working system
- Consider using containers (Docker) and cloud deployments (AWS ECS/Fargate or Amplify)
